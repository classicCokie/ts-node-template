# ts-node-template
A template I like to use when setting up new node servers using typescript and express.

## Directory Structure

src/ -> All Server Files
src/routes -> All the Routes that are setup
src/handlers -> The handlers called upon the different routes

## How to use
Starting it up
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```



# Future Todos
